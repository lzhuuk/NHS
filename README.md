# NHS Workplacement
##
This platform is being launched as a demonstration of the successful collaborative work between the EHRS program and the university postgraduates' (master and PhD students) work placement. These students are under close supervision of Leilei Zhu, Clinical Data Standards Lead. We use business intelligence and information processing tools, e.g. Python to reduce the manual labour of complex data analytics. 

We made it open source and willing to share with the community.
Each piece of analysis presented here, has been implemented and configured in the Epic EHRS program. This also provides an opportunity for the students to experience the real issues with NHS data, culture and deployment of any EHRS program.
